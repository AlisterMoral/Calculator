# Calculator

I started the calculator project by creating multiple function that add,subtract,multiply,divie then tested them in the console.

Created a calculator operation by creating 3 variable 1 for the firstnumber one for the operator and last one for the seconde number.

Then created a new function called operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers.
